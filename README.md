#  MyDiary

## Summary

I like Makoto Shinkai's (新海 誠) movies very much! This project is just trying to create the app - "My Diary" in "your name." on Android. In this movie, "My Diary" is an important app between Taki(瀧) and Mitsuha(三葉). As a fan, I think maybe I can implement this app. If you also like "your name.", please join me to finish the "My Diary", and let it become real.

This project will need :
* Android developer
* GUI designer
* Japanese/English translation 

This project has be re-created in 2016-11-04 because there were some personal infos in the old git repository.

So if you have already starred or forked the repo, you can do it again, thanks :)

## Why is there only the Android version?

In fact, Android version is more difficult than iOS, because this app is running on iOS in the movie. But I will only create the Android version for now because:

1. I don't have a mac for now :P
2. Android apks are easy to release.

So, maybe I will try to create an iOS version after this app is running.
